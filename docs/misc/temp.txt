U+251C

Also, how do I make the symbol that looks like "|__" but only uses one character?

answer: "box-drawing character", "lower left corner", or "corner" character:
U+2514, \u2514
The Unicode standard includes a whole set of characters specifically designed
for drawing boxes and lines.  These are called box-drawing characters.
They are in the Unicode block called "Box Drawing" (U+2500–U+257F).
• U+250C (┌):  BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DOWN AND RIGHT (upper left corner)
• U+2510 (┐):  BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT DOWN AND LEFT (upper right corner)
• U+2514 (└):  BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT UP AND RIGHT (lower left corner)
• U+2518 (┘):  BOX DRAWINGS LIGHT UP AND LEFT (lower right corner)
