Breaking Down the Learning Path

Here's a breakdown of the key areas you'll need to study, along with resources
and a suggested learning path:

I. Foundational Concepts

1.  Formal Languages and Grammars:

    *   What to Learn:

        *   Context-Free Grammars (CFGs): The foundation of most programming
            language syntax.
        *   Regular Expressions: Used for defining tokens in lexers.
        *   Backus-Naur Form (BNF) and Extended BNF (EBNF): Common notations
            for writing grammars.
        *   Derivations: How to derive strings from a grammar.
        *   Parse Trees and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs): The structured
            representations of parsed code.
        *   Ambiguity: How to identify and resolve ambiguity in grammars.
    *   Why It's Important: You need to be able to read and understand the
        grammar in RFC 9535 (Appendix A) and to define your own grammar for
        JSONPath.
    *   Resources:

        *   "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools" (The Dragon Book): A
            classic and comprehensive textbook on compiler construction. It
            covers grammars in detail.
        *   Online Tutorials: Many online tutorials explain CFGs, BNF, and
            regular expressions.
        *   Wikipedia: The Wikipedia articles on these topics are generally
            quite good.

2.  Lexical Analysis (Lexing/Tokenizing):

    *   What to Learn:

        *   Tokens: What they are and how they're defined.
        *   Lexical Analysis Process: How raw text is converted into a stream
            of tokens.
        *   Regular Expressions: How to use them to define token patterns.
        *   Lexical Errors: How to detect and handle them.
    *   Why It's Important: You need to be able to break down a JSONPath
        expression into its constituent parts (e.g., $., [*], ., word,
        [?(...), etc.).
    *   Resources:

        *   The Dragon Book: Has a good section on lexical analysis.
        *   "Modern Compiler Implementation in C/Java/ML" (The Tiger Book):
            Another excellent compiler textbook.
        *   Regular Expression Tutorials: Many online resources teach regular
            expressions.
        *   re module in Python: Learn how to use Python's built-in regular
            expression module.

3.  Syntactic Analysis (Parsing):

    *   What to Learn:

        *   Top-Down Parsing: Recursive descent, LL parsing.
        *   Bottom-Up Parsing: LR, LALR, SLR parsing.
        *   Shift-Reduce Parsing: The fundamental mechanism of LR parsers.
        *   Parsing Tables: How they're constructed and used.
        *   Parse Tree/AST Construction: How to build a structured
            representation of the input.
        *   Syntax Errors: How to detect and handle them.
    *   Why It's Important: You need to be able to take the stream of tokens
        from the lexer and determine if they form a valid JSONPath expression
        according to the grammar.
    *   Resources:

        *   The Dragon Book: Has extensive coverage of parsing techniques.
        *   The Tiger Book: Another excellent resource.
        *   Online Tutorials: Many online tutorials explain parsing techniques.
        *   PLY (Python Lex-Yacc): The library used by jsonpath-ng. It's a
            good way to get hands-on experience with lexing and parsing.

4.  Semantic Analysis:

    *   What to Learn:

        *   Attribute Grammars: A way to add semantic information to a
            grammar.
        *   Symbol Tables: How to store information about identifiers.
        *   Type Checking: (If you want to add type checking to your JSONPath
            implementation).
        *   Semantic Errors: How to detect and handle them.
    *   Why It's Important: You need to be able to go beyond just checking the
        syntax and determine if a JSONPath expression is meaningful (e.g., does
        it make sense to access a property that doesn't exist?).
    *   Resources:

        *   The Dragon Book: Has a good section on semantic analysis.
        *   The Tiger Book: Another excellent resource.

II. Practical Tools and Techniques

1.  Lexer/Parser Generators:

    *   PLY (Python Lex-Yacc): A Python implementation of Lex and Yacc. It's a
        good choice for this project because it's what jsonpath-ng uses.
    *   ANTLR: Another popular parser generator that supports a variety of
        parsing techniques.
    *   What to Learn: How to use these tools to define a grammar, generate a
        lexer and parser, and build an AST.
    *   Why It's Important: These tools will automate much of the tedious work
        of building a lexer and parser by hand.
    *   Resources:

        *   PLY Documentation: The official documentation for PLY.
        *   ANTLR Documentation: The official documentation for ANTLR.
        *   Examples: Look for examples of how to use these tools.

2.  Python:

    *   What to Learn:

        *   Object-Oriented Programming: You'll likely want to use classes to
            represent tokens, AST nodes, etc.
        *   Data Structures: Lists, dictionaries, and trees will be essential.
        *   Error Handling: You'll need to handle lexical, syntax, and semantic
            errors.
    *   Why It's Important: You'll be implementing your JSONPath engine in
        Python.
    *   Resources:

        *   Python Documentation: The official Python documentation.
        *   Online Tutorials: Many excellent Python tutorials are available.

III. The JSONPath Project

    *   Define Tokens: Decide what the tokens are (e.g., $., [*], ., word,
        [?(...), etc.).
    *   Use Regular Expressions: Write regular expressions to match each token
        type.
    *   Use PLY: Use PLY to generate the lexer.

5.  Implement the Parser:

    *   Use Your Grammar: Use your grammar to guide the parser's construction.
    *   Use PLY: Use PLY to generate the parser.
    *   Build the AST: Have the parser build an AST as it parses the input.

6.  Implement the Semantic Processing:

    *   AST Traversal: Write code to traverse the AST.
    *   Evaluation: Write code to evaluate the JSONPath expression against a
        JSON object.

7.  Testing:
